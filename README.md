# Saatva News Hiring Test
This repository contains all of the artifacts I have created for the "Saatva News" hiring test. While vanilla JavaScript/HTML/CSS would have been more than adequate to this project, I chose to build this application with React as it would be directly relevant to the position at hand.

I thank you for the opportunity to show you my wares, and hope you enjoy!

## Hosted Solution
The solution has been <a href="http://saatva.thisiteration.com" target="_blank">deployed on my website</a> for easy viewing.

## Distribution Build 
"dist/dorfman_hiring-test_build.zip" contains the "production-ready" app as built with NPM 6.4.1 from the source code residing in this repo as of the final commit. The app is configured to use relative asset paths, so you may unzip the archive and put the contents in any directory on a web server.

## Build from source
You may clone the repository and run locally with "npm start".
